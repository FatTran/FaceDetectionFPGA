INFO: [COSIM 212-302] Starting C TB testing ... 
ERROR: System received a signal named SIGSEGV and the program has to stop immediately!
This signal was generated when a program tries to read or write outside the memory that is allocated for it, or to write memory that can only be read.
Possible cause of this problem may be:
  1) Missing depth information for one or more pointers to arrays in the interface;
  2) Insufficient depth setting for array argument(s);
  3) Excessive depth setting for array argument(s), that exceeds the maximum virtual memory size for the process;
  4) Null pointer etc.
Current execution stopped during CodeState = ENTER_WRAPC.
You can search CodeState variable name in apatb*.cpp file under ./sim/wrapc dir to locate the position.
